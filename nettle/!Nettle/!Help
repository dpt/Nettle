Nettle - Telnet and terminal emulation for RISC OS
==================================================

Version : 0.2050r : July 28th, 2023.

Nettle is *the* terminal emulator and telnet client for the RISC OS
operating system. It utilises the ZapRedraw module for speedy display and
is a fast, clean native implementation.

Nettle's aim is to be the definitive terminal emulator and telnet client
for RISC OS.  A range of terminal emulation options will be supported,
along with full colour and graphics.  An ANSI task window is provided, so
that ports of unix programs which provide ANSI output can be run on RISC
OS in full colour and form.  (Programs such as ncftp2, BitchX, nano, lynx).
Other highlights include an optional line editor with history, hotlisting,
multiple terminal support and URL launching.  Eventually, Nettle will also
contain Secure Shell (SSH) support.


Requirements
============

Nettle uses the ZapRedraw module for display.  If !Zap or !ZapFonts have
been "seen" on your system (often by virtue of having !ZapFonts in the
!Boot.Resources directory) then you will have a wide variety of fonts
to choose from within Nettle.  If Nettle cannot find any fonts, then it
will fall back to using two contained inside its own structure.

Nettle currently requires Wimp 3.50 or better.  All versions of RISC OS
can have at least Wimp 3.98 ("Nested Wimp") loaded, however, users of
RISC OS 3.1 may not have this installed and see some reduction in
functionality.  Nettle makes use of menus with sprites - there is a known
bug in WIMP versions prior to RISC OS Select 2i3 (RISC OS 4.33) which
means that these menus may occasionally display incorrectly.

In common with other RISC OS internet access software, to connect to
other machines, then !Internet must be operational on your computer.
The Acorn/ANT 'Resolver' module is also required.  Nettle also
makes use of the "SocketWatch" module for improved performance - an
installer is provided.  This module is not required if running
Internet 5.42 or better (Select 2 or later) then you don't need to use
the Socketwatch module as the functionality is provided by the OS
(Socket pollwords).   Also note that if you only wish to use the ANSI
task window facilities of Nettle, then !Internet is not required.

Finally, Nettle makes use of the ColourPicker module.  This must be
present in your system ROM or !System folder.


"Dummies guide" to using Nettle
===============================

Unpack !Nettle to your harddrive and doubleclick on it - an icon will
appear on the right hand side of your iconbar.  Clicking SELECT on this
icon will open the connection window.  Enter an internet host name in
to the "Host" icon, optionally supplying a port number after a colon.
Click to "Connect" button and a connection will be attempted - a larger
terminal window will appear, showing connection status.  If all goes
will, you will be able to use the service you requested.   Once finished,
simply close the window.


Using Nettle
============

Creating connections

Clicking on the Nettle iconbar icon will display the connection dialog.
From here you may choose the connection type (Telnet/SSH/ANSI task)
and terminal emulation desired (vt100/vt102/vt220/xterm).  The hostname
and port ("host.name:port") can be entered below for telnet and ssh
connections.  For ssh and ANSI Task connections, the command icon will
be available to supply a default command to run (eg "bash").


Using the terminal

Once a connection is made, the terminal can be used as normal.  If a
line editor has been enabled (the initial default is "off") then the
input will be line-buffered locally and up/down cursors will scroll
through a history.  This may be undesirable for interactive programs
running via the terminal or for password entry.  Nettle will print a
message in the window when the session has ended.

During use of the terminal, the mouse can be used to select areas of
text in the usual RISC OS manner.  An application menu (click the
middle mouse button in the terminal window) will allow the selection
to be cleared, transmitted via the terminal, or saved to disc in either
plain text or full ANSI format.   The menu also gives access to a resize
dialog allowing the terminal size and scrollback to be changed.

Note that when remote mousing is in operation (eg when running "pico -m")
then local mouse operations will not function - selection and the session
menu will be unavailable.


Tailoring Nettle's defaults

The default terminal size, font, colours, scrollback size and so on can
all be modified from within Nettle:  Choose the "Choices..." option from
Nettle's iconbar menu and the main Choices window will appear.  Choices
are split in to several categories (Size/Colour/Hotlist...) and clicking
on the radio buttons at the top right will display choices for that
category.  Update the choices as you desire, then click "Set" to set
them for the current run only, or click "Save" to save them as defaults
which are reloaded the next time Nettle is run.


Hotlist

Nettle has a hotlist feature, similar to most web browsers.  Sites that
you connect to regularly, and terminal settings for those sites, can be
defined as a hotlist item and saved to disc for quick access.  The
hotlist editor can be seen by selecting the "hotlist" option in Nettle's
choices window.  From here a new hotlist item can be created, existing
items may be edited or deleted, and the list can be reordered by dragging
items around.  To select an item for edit/delete/copy, just click on it.
Dragging items will allow the list to be reordered to suit usage.
Doubleclicking will go straight in to the item edit mode.  The hotlist
is saved to disc when you select "Save" from the Choices window and
loaded when Nettle is loaded.  You can access the hotlist by clicking
ADJUST on the Nettle iconbar icon or from the "Hotlist" iconbar submenu.


Main window

All input to nettle is via the main connection windows of course.  If
a line editor has been enabled, then it will appear as a pane hanging
below the window.  Enter text in here as usual and hit ENTER to send it.
The line editor has a "history" - use up and down cursor keys to access
recently entered commands.   This line editor is useful for slow
connections - eg telnet over a modem or to a distant site.  If the line
editor type has been set to "Optional" then there will be a checkbox to
the right of the window to allow it to be temporarily disbled (eg when
you need raw mode input, or want to enter a password).  If the line
editor is set to "Permanent" then the line editor window will always be
active, but clicking in the window will allow raw input - this is akin
to the behaviour of apps such as ANTTerm.   Try each option and see which
suits you best.

You can mark a selection of text in the main window in the usual RISC OS
manner.  This selection can then be saved by simply dragging it to a filer
window or another app.  Clicking menu will open the terminal menu where
you can follow the "Selection ->" item and save via a standard save dialog.
This also allows you to save out the full ANSI control code info too.
The application menu also allows you to send the marked area back to the
terminal.

Nettle can launch URLs for you.  Doubleclicking on any word in a terminal
window will attempt to launch a RISC OS web browser for that text.  Nettle
supports all common URL launching mechanisms (Fresco/Oregano/Browse).

Nettle supports the global clipboard via entries on the session menu and
files can be dragged to a session window to transmit their contents.

For systems that output ANSI graphics characters, you may intially see
"top bit" characters (with accents) drawn.  You should switch to a font
which draws these as block graphics - eg "08x16.PC" font.  This is seen
when connecting to ArcadeBBS for example.


ANSI task
=========

Nettle provides a ANSI task, primarily to allow ported Unix programs
which have ANSI output to be run on RISC OS.  The task window operates
slightly differently from other task window implementations (eg Zap/Edit)
to allow for this ANSI emulation.  Don't expect to run "normal" interactive
RISC OS programs in here (e.g. BASIC, gos) because they will not function
in the way you expect - ANSI terminal control is quite different to
RISC OS.   Programs which are intended to be run via Nettle's ANSI Task
include nano (pico), tinyfugue, lynx, BitchX, ncftp2 and so on.  Nettle
is the only RISC OS program that we know of that provides this kind of
functionality and allows these unix ports to be run at their best.


Project background
==================

Alex Macfarlane Smith started the project, initially writing a very well
featured version of Nettle in BBC BASIC. Unfortunately, this was rather
too slow to be really useful, so after some encouragement, the move was
made to a C-language based development. This is when the other developers
started work. 

Nettle currently supports vt100, vt102, vt220, linux and xterm terminal
emulation. This is now fairly fully fledged and working well - support
for other common terminal standards (vt320, vt52) is planned for later. 

Opensource development is managed via SourceForge - feel free to submit
patches and bug reports via that system: http://nettle.sourceforge.net/

"To do" list - forthcoming features and ideas
=============================================

We're still working on Nettle.  Honest.  Here's a roughly ordered list
of things that will be added in future versions.  Please feel free to
submit new ideas:  mailto:archifishal@users.sourceforge.net

* ANSI commandline task shell for ANSI task window (ROSH)
* VT 320/420/510
* rlogin
* SSH


Known issues / bugs
===================

If you find a bug that isn't related to the list of unfinished items
above, and isn't a known bug shown below, please let us know:
mailto:archifishal@users.sourceforge.net

* Terminal emulation incomplete - esoteric vt commands unimplemented
* ANSI task cannot be used as a "regular" taskwindow.
  - It never will, because it interprets codes as ANSI - that's its
    whole point in life.  This will be improved by "ROSH"
